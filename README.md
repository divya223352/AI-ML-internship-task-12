🔍 The Elbow Method & Inertia
Determining the number of clusters (K) is the most important step in K-Means.
Inertia (WCSS): This is the "Within-Cluster Sum of Squares." It measures how far the points within a cluster are from their centroid.
The "Elbow" Logic: As K increases, inertia always decreases. However, there is a point where adding more clusters doesn't provide significantly better information. That "bend" in the graph is the Elbow.
💡 Business Interpretation (The "So What?")
The final outcome of this task is to turn data into a marketing strategy. Here is what the typical 5 clusters represent:
High Income, High Spending (Target): These are your "Diamond" customers. Marketing should focus on luxury items and loyalty rewards.
High Income, Low Spending (Careful): These customers have the money but don't spend it. Marketing should focus on high-quality advertisements or discounts to entice them.
Low Income, High Spending (Spendthrifts): These customers spend despite low income. They respond well to "buy now, pay later" schemes or trendy, affordable items.
Low Income, Low Spending (Sensible): Budget-conscious shoppers. They respond to mass-market discounts and "value for money" messaging.
Average Income, Average Spending (Standard): The middle-class baseline. They are steady but not the primary focus for specialized campaigns.
